## Usage

The game has two players, playing in rounds. In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their round score. But, if the player rolls a 1, all their round score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.

The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their round score gets added to their global score. After that, it's the next player's turn.

The first player to reach 100 points on global score wins the game.
